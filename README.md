# bayes_theorem_in_python

This project applies Bayes Theorem to determine whether a sport should be played based on weather conditions. Using a hypothetical dataset, it calculates probabilities and offers recommendations using Bayesian methods.

Key components:

  -Prior Probability: Calculates the likelihood of playing (Yes/No) from historical data.
  
  -Likelihood: Measures the probability of a weather condition given that a game is played or not.
  
  -Posterior Probability: Combines prior probability and likelihood to estimate the probability of playing a sport under certain weather conditions.
  
  -Probabilistic Analysis: Analyses the likelihood of playing based on conditions such as "Sunny", "Overcast", and "Rainy".
  
  -Bootstrap Confidence Intervals: Estimates confidence intervals for each weather condition's play probability.
  
  -Decision Analysis: Provides a recommendation on whether to play based on Bayesian probabilities and statistical significance.
